## Work Flow

Everyone worked together to complete this project, however each team member had their own feature that they focused on.

* Felipe Dunbar: Built the sales feature for the application. This consisted of allowing the employee to sell a product to a member, add an item to the inventory, and list the sales history. Styled the templates for the forms.

* Joseph Fitzpatrick: Built the members feature for the application. This involved listing the members, adding a member, and updating a member's information. Created the base styling template for the application.

* Alazar Abraham: Built the login function using firebase. Firebase was used to store employee login information and authenticated employee logins. Introduced Material UI components and designed the tables.

* Tasks for each day were determined at the start of the day to keep the team on track towards the "MVP".

* GitHub was used profusely to ensure that code was up to date. Team members were constantly pushing and committing code. Code was pulled at the beginning and end everyday to keep the team on the same page before beginning production for the day.
